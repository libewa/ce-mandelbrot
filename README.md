# CE-Mandelbrot
Create Mandelbrot fractals on your Texas Instruments TI84+ CE graphing calculator.

From Wikipedia:
> The \[Mandelbrot\] set is defined in the complex plane as the complex numbers $c$ for which the function $$f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c$$ does not diverge to infinity when iterated starting at $z=0$.

Because computer screens, just like fixed-point complex numbers, are a two-dimensional space with fixed numbers, they are often used to display graphics (fractals) of the set.

## How to use:
Upload the program using TiLP or TI Connect CE and run it. If you get an error like "Attempted to use a variable or function where it was not valid", you will need to jailbreak your calculator. See https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/ for more info.

Once the program is running, you will see a black line slowly come in from the left of the screen. Wait for the image to be drawn. If you want to quit at any time, or after it is done, press the On button.
