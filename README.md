# CE-Mandelbrot
Create Mandelbrot fractals on your Texas Instruments TI84+ CE graphing calculator.

From Wikipedia:
> The [Mandelbrot] set is defined in the complex plane as the complex numbers $c$ for which the function $$f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c$$ does not diverge to infinity when iterated starting at $z=0$.

Because computer screens, just like fixed-point complex numbers, are a two-dimensional space with fixed numbers, they are often used to display graphics (fractals) of the set.
